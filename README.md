open-headtracker versions

 all founded forks of original DIY_Headtracker ( in DIY_Headtracker_firmware_orig )

DIY_Headtracker_firmware_fastserial - changed to FastSerial library with printf_P, uses ATAN2 (no more NAN!), add noise filter and some cleanup
 - It works!



DIY_headtracker-8mhz - port to 8mhz Arduino (as is)
and others for different sensors (as is)

main one:
DIY_Headtracker_firmware - changed filter to Madgwick AHRS (http://www.x-io.co.uk/node/8#open_source_ahrs_and_imu_algorithms)
 but still don'd work
