open-headtracker versions (http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1677559&page=207)

 all founded forks of original DIY_Headtracker ( in DIY_Headtracker_firmware_orig )


DIY_headtracker-8mhz - port to 8mhz Arduino (as is)
and others for different sensors (as is)

main one:
DIY_Headtracker_firmware_fastserial - changed to FastSerial library with printf_P, uses ATAN2 (no more NAN!), add noise filter and some cleanup
 - It works!
